Staker Configuration Guide
==========================

NuCypher staking operations are divided into two roles "Staker" and "Worker" - This Guide is for Stakers.

Staker Overview
----------------

*Staker* - Controls NU tokens, manages staking, and collects rewards.

The Staker is a manager of one or more stakes, delegating active network participation to a *Worker* through *bonding*.
There is a 1:1 relationship between the roles: A Staker controls a single ethereum account and may have multiple Stakes,
but only ever has one Worker. A fully synced ethereum node is required - The staker's account needs NU tokens to stake
as well as enough ether to pay for transaction gas. Stakers can run on a laptop and do not need to remain online since
they only need to perform stake management transactions. Using a hardware wallet is *highly* recommended, they are ideal
for stakers since only temporarily access to private keys is required during stake management while providing a higher standard
of security than software wallets.

Staking Procedure:

1) Install ``nucypher`` on Staker's machine (see :doc:`/guides/installation_guide`)
2) Establish ethereum account, provider, and signer (see `Staking`_)
3) Request testnet tokens by joining the `Discord server <https://discord.gg/7rmXa3S>`_ and type ``.getfunded <YOUR_STAKER_ETH_ADDRESS>`` in the #testnet-faucet channel
4) Initialize a new StakeHolder and Stake (see `Initialize a new stakeholder`_)
5) Initialize a new stake (see `Initialize a new stake`_)
6) Bond a Worker to a Staker using the worker's ethereum address (see `Bonding a Worker`_)


Staking CLI
------------

All staking-related operations done by Staker are performed through the ``nucypher stake`` command:

.. code:: bash

Staking
--------

Staking transactions can be broadcast using either a local or remote ethereum node.
By default transaction signing requests are forwarded to the configured ethereum provider;
This is the typical configuration for locally or independently run ethereum nodes.
In order to use a remote ethereum provider (e.g. Alchemy, Infura, Public Remote Node) an external transaction signing client
(e.g. clef or geth) is needed separate from the broadcasting node.

Below we describe the usage of both local and remote ethereum providers...

Running an Ethereum Node for Staking (Local Provider)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here we describe the steps required to run an ethereum node for both transaction signing and broadcast.
This is the typical configuration for a locally operated trusted ethereum node.

Assuming you have ``geth`` installed, let's run a node on the GÃ¶rli testnet.

.. code:: bash

    $ geth --goerli

If you want to use your hardware wallet, just connect it to your machine. You'll see something like this in logs:

.. code:: bash

    INFO [08-30|15:50:39.153] New wallet appeared      url=ledger://0001:000b:00      status="Ethereum app v1.2.7 online"

If you see something like ``New wallet appeared, failed to open`` in the logs,
you need to reconnect the hardware wallet (without turning the ``geth`` node
off).

If you don't have a hardware wallet, you can create a software one:

Whilst running the initialized node:

.. code:: bash

    Linux:
    $ geth attach /home/<username>/.ethereum/goerli/geth.ipc
    > personal.newAccount();
    > eth.accounts
    ["0x287a817426dd1ae78ea23e9918e2273b6733a43d"]

    MacOS:
    $ geth attach /Users/<username>/Library/Ethereum/goerli/geth.ipc
    > personal.newAccount();
    > eth.accounts
    ["0x287a817426dd1ae78ea23e9918e2273b6733a43d"]

Where ``0x287a817426dd1ae78ea23e9918e2273b6733a43d`` is your newly created
account address and ``<username>`` is your user.

Using Clef as an external transaction signer (Remote Provider)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. important::

    External signing support is an experimental feature and under active development.

Motivation
**********

Instead of using a local ethereum node for both transaction signing and broadcast, an external signer can be specified
and operated independently of the provider/broadcaster. This separation allows stakers to use local hardware and software wallets
to send pre-signed transactions to an external (possibly remote) ethereum node.

Some examples:

- Infura/Alchemy/Etc. for broadcasting with clef signer
- Local geth node for broadcasting with clef signer
- Remote ethereum node for broadcasting with local geth signer


Clef Setup
**********

We'll quickly walk through setup steps below, but additional in-depth documentation on clef can
be found in the source repository here https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/tree/master/cmd/clef

Clef is typically installed alongside geth.  If you already have geth installed on you system you
may already have clef installed.  To check for an existing installation run:

.. code:: bash

    $ clef --version
    Clef version 0.0.0

If clef was not found, upgrade geth to the latest version and try again.

Next, initialize Clef with your chosen password to encrypt the master seed:

.. code:: bash

    $ clef init
    ...
    The master seed of clef will be locked with a password.
    Please specify a password. Do not forget this password!
    Password:


Running Clef for Goerli
***********************

Clef can use hardware wallets (ledger and trezor) over USB, or geth formatted private keys
by specifying the keystore directory path:

.. code:: bash

    $ clef --keystore <PATH TO GOERLI KEYSTORE> --chainid 5 --advanced


- <PATH TO KEYSTORE> - The path to the directory containing geth-formatted private key files; the default path for Linux is ``~/.ethereum/goerli/keystore``.
- Chain ID 5 is specified to ensure clef signs transactions with the network ID of Goerli.


.. code:: bash

    Enter 'ok' to proceed:
    > ok
   ...

    ------- Signer info -------
    * extapi_version : 6.0.0
    * extapi_http : n/a
    * extapi_ipc : /home/user/.clef/clef.ipc
    * intapi_version : 7.0.0


Using clef with nucypher commands
*********************************

.. code:: bash

    $ nucypher <COMMAND> <ACTION> --signer <CLEF IPC PATH> --hw-wallet

Some examples:

.. code:: bash

    # Create a new stakeholder with clef as the default signer
    $ nucypher stake init-stakeholder --signer ~/clef/clef.ipc ...

    # Update an existing configuration with clef as the default signer
    $ nucypher stake config --signer ~/clef/clef.ipc  # Set clef as the default signer

    # Create a new stake using inline signer and provider values
    $ nucypher stake create --signer ~/clef/clef.ipc --provider ~/.ethereum/goerli/geth.ipc


Interacting with clef
*********************

Requests for account management, and signing will be directed at clef, with a 10 second timeout.
Be alert for user-interactive requests and confirmations from the clef CLI.


Initialize a new stakeholder
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before continuing with stake initiation and management, A setup step is required to configure nucypher for staking.
This will create a configuration file (`~/.local/share/nucypher/stakeholder.josn`) containing editable configuration values.

.. code:: bash

    (nucypher)$ nucypher stake init-stakeholder --provider <PROVIDER> --network <NETWORK_NAME>

If you ran ``geth`` node as above, your ``<PROVIDER>`` is
``ipc:///home/<username>/.ethereum/goerli/geth.ipc``
(on MacOS, ``ipc:///Users/<username>/Library/Ethereum/goerli/geth.ipc``)

``<NETWORK_NAME>`` is the name of the NuCypher network domain where the staker will participate.

.. note:: If you're participating in NuCypher's incentivized testnet, this name is ``gemini``.


Initialize a new stake
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you have configured nucypher for staking, you can proceed with stake initiation.
This operation will transfer an amount of tokens to nucypher's staking escrow contract and lock them for
the commitment period.

.. note:: Use ``--hw-wallet`` if you are using a hardware wallet or clef to prevent password prompts.

.. code:: bash

    (nucypher)$ nucypher stake create --hw-wallet

    Select staking account [0]: 0
    Enter stake value in NU [15000]: 15000
    Enter stake duration (30 periods minimum): 30

    ============================== STAGED STAKE ==============================

    * Ursula Node Operator Notice *
    -------------------------------

    By agreeing to stake 15000 NU (15000000000000000000000 NuNits):

    - Staked tokens will be locked for the stake duration.

    - You are obligated to maintain a networked and available Ursula-Worker node
      bonded to the staker address 0xbb01c4fE50f91eF73c5dD6eD89f38D55A6b1EdCA for the duration
      of the stake(s) (30 periods).

    - Agree to allow NuCypher network users to carry out uninterrupted re-encryption
      work orders at-will without interference.

    Failure to keep your node online, or violation of re-encryption work orders
    will result in the loss of staked tokens as described in the NuCypher slashing protocol.

    Keeping your Ursula node online during the staking period and successfully
    producing correct re-encryption work orders will result in rewards
    paid out in ethers retro-actively and on-demand.

If you used a hardware wallet, you will need to confirm two transactions here.


List existing stakes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you have created one or more stakes, you can view all active stake for connected wallets:

.. code:: bash

    (nucypher)$ nucypher stake list

    ======================================= Active Stakes =========================================

    | ~ | Staker | Worker | # | Value    | Duration     | Enactment
    |   | ------ | ------ | - | -------- | ------------ | -----------------------------------------
    | 0 | 0xbb01 | 0xdead | 0 | 15000 NU | 41 periods . | Aug 04 12:15:16 CEST - Sep 13 12:15:16 CEST
    | 1 | 0xbb02 | 0xbeef | 1 | 15000 NU | 30 periods . | Aug 20 12:15:16 CEST - Sep 18 12:15:16 CEST
    | 2 | 0xbb03 | 0x0000 | 0 | 30000 NU | 30 periods . | Aug 09 12:15:16 CEST - Sep 9 12:15:16 CEST

If the Worker in the list is shown as ``0x0000``, it means that you haven't yet
attached a Worker node to your Staker, so you still have to do it!

.. _bond-worker:

Bonding a Worker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After initiating a stake, the staker must delegate access to a work address through *bonding*.
There is a 1:1 relationship between the roles: A Staker may have multiple Stakes but only ever has one Worker at a time.

.. note:: The Worker cannot be changed for a minimum of 2 periods once set.

.. note:: Stakers without a worker bonded will be highlighted in yellow (sometimes called "Detached" or "Headless").

.. code:: bash

    (nucypher)$ nucypher stake set-worker --hw-wallet

    ======================================= Active Stakes =========================================

    | ~ | Staker | Worker | # | Value    | Duration     | Enactment
    |   | ------ | ------ | - | -------- | ------------ | -----------------------------------------
    | 0 | 0xbb01 | 0xdead | 0 | 15000 NU | 41 periods . | Aug 04 12:15:16 CEST - Sep 13 12:15:16 CEST
    | 1 | 0xbb02 | 0xbeef | 1 | 15000 NU | 30 periods . | Aug 20 12:15:16 CEST - Sep 18 12:15:16 CEST
    | 2 | 0xbb03 | 0x0000 | 0 | 30000 NU | 30 periods . | Aug 09 12:15:16 CEST - Sep 9 12:15:16 CEST

    Select Stake: 2
    Enter Worker Address: 0xbeefc4fE50f91eF73c5dD6eD89f38D55A6b1EdCA
    Worker 0xbb04c4fE50f91eF73c5dD6eD89f38D55A6b1EdCA successfully bonded to staker 0xbb03...

    OK!

.. note:: The worker's address must be EIP-55 checksum valid, however, geth shows addresses in the normalized format.
          You can convert the normalized address to checksum format in geth console:

.. code:: bash

    $ geth attach ~/.ethereum/goerli/geth.ipc
    > eth.accounts
    ["0x287a817426dd1ae78ea23e9918e2273b6733a43d", "0xc080708026a3a280894365efd51bb64521c45147"]
    > web3.toChecksumAddress(eth.accounts[0])
    "0x287A817426DD1AE78ea23e9918e2273b6733a43D"

After this step, you're finished with the Staker, and you can proceed to :ref:`ursula-config-guide`.


Modifying Active Stakes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Several administrative operations can be performed on active stakes:

+----------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Action               |  Description                                                                  |
+======================+===============================================================================+
|  ``restake``         | Manage automatic reward re-staking                                            |
+----------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|  ``prolong``         | Prolong an existing stake's duration                                          |
+----------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|  ``winddown``        | Manage winding down of stakes                                                 |
+----------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|  ``divide``          | Create a new stake from part of an existing one                               |
+----------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+


Manage automatic reward re-staking
**********************************

As your Ursula performs work, all rewards are automatically added to your existing stake to optimize earnings.
This feature, called `re-staking`, is *enabled* by default.

To disable re-staking:

.. code:: bash

    (nucypher)$ nucypher stake restake --disable

To enable re-staking again:

.. code:: bash

    (nucypher)$ nucypher stake restake --enable


Additionally, you can enable **re-stake locking**, an on-chain commitment to continue re-staking
until a future period (``release_period``). Once enabled, the `StakingEscrow` contract will not
allow **re-staking** to be disabled until the release period begins, even if you are the stake owner.

.. code:: bash

    (nucypher)$ nucypher stake restake --lock-until 12345

No action is needed to release the re-staking lock once the release period begins.


.. _staking-prolong:

Prolong
*******

Existing stakes can be extended by a number of periods as long as the resulting
stake's duration is not longer than the maximum. To prolong an existing stake's duration:

.. code:: bash

    (nucypher)$ nucypher stake prolong --hw-wallet


Wind Down
**********

Wind down is *disabled* by default. To start winding down an existing stake:

.. code:: bash

    (nucypher)$ nucypher stake winddown --hw-wallet


Divide
******

Existing stakes can be divided into smaller :ref:`sub-stakes <sub-stakes>`, with different values and durations. Dividing a stake
allows stakers to accommodate different liquidity needs since sub-stakes can have different durations. Therefore, a
staker can liquidate a portion of their overall stake at an earlier time.

To divide an existing stake:

.. code:: bash

    (nucypher)$ nucypher stake divide --hw-wallet

    Select Stake: 2
    Enter target value (must be less than or equal to 30000 NU): 15000
    Enter number of periods to extend: 1

Collect rewards earned by the staker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

NuCypher nodes earn two types of rewards: staking rewards (in NU) and policy rewards (i.e., service fees in ETH).
To collect these rewards use ``nucypher stake collect-reward`` with flags ``--staking-reward`` and ``--policy-reward``
(or even both).

While staking rewards can only be collected to the original staker account, you can decide which account receives
policy rewards using the ``--withdraw-address <ETH_ADDRESS>`` flag.

.. code:: bash

    (nucypher)$ nucypher stake collect-reward --staking-reward --policy-reward --staking-address 0x287A817426DD1AE78ea23e9918e2273b6733a43D --hw-wallet

You can run ``nucypher stake accounts`` to verify that your staking compensation
is indeed in your wallet. Use your favorite Ethereum wallet (MyCrypto or Metamask
are suitable) to transfer out the compensation earned (NU tokens or ETH) after
that.

Note that you will need to confirm two transactions if you collect both types of
staking compensation if you use a hardware wallet.

Staking using a preallocation contract
---------------------------------------

Each NuCypher staker with a preallocation will have some amount of tokens locked
in a preallocation contract named ``PreallocationEscrow``, which is used to stake and
perform other staker-related operations.
From the perspective of the main NuCypher contracts, each ``PreallocationEscrow``
contract represents a staker, no different from "regular" stakers.
However, from the perspective of the preallocation user, things are different
since the contract can't perform transactions, and it's the preallocation user
(also known as the "`beneficiary`" of the contract)
who has to perform staking operations.

As part of the preallocation process, beneficiaries receive an allocation file,
containing the ETH addresses of their beneficiary account and corresponding
preallocation contract.

In general, preallocation users can use all staking-related operations offered
by the CLI in the same way as described above, except that they have to specify
the path to the allocation file using the option ``--allocation-filepath PATH``.

For example, to create a stake:

.. code:: bash

    (nucypher)$ nucypher stake create --hw-wallet --allocation-filepath PATH


Or to set a worker:

.. code:: bash

    (nucypher)$ nucypher stake set-worker --hw-wallet --allocation-filepath PATH


As an alternative to the ``--allocation-filepath`` flag, preallocation users
can directly specify their beneficiary and staking contract addresses with the
``--beneficiary-address ADDRESS`` and ``--staking-address ADDRESS``, respectively.

Finally, note that collected staking rewards are always placed in the original
staking account, which for preallocation users is the staking contract.
Run the following command to view the balance of the ``PreallocationEscrow`` contract:

.. code:: bash

    (nucypher)$ nucypher stake preallocation --status --allocation-filepath PATH

    -------------------------- Addresses ---------------------------
    Staking contract: ... 0x0f4Ebe8a28a8eF33bEcD6A3782D74308FC35D021
    Beneficiary: ........ 0x4f5e87f833faF9a747463f7E4387a0d9323a3979

    ------------------------ Locked Tokens -------------------------
    Initial locked amount: 35000 NU
    Current locked amount: 35000 NU
    Locked until: ........ 2020-12-31 16:33:37+00:00

    ---------------------- NU and ETH Balance ----------------------
    NU balance: .......... 17.345 NU
        Available: ....... 12.345 NU
    ETH balance: ......... 0 ETH


To withdraw the unlocked tokens, you need to retrieve them from the
``PreallocationEscrow`` contract using the following command:

.. code:: bash

    (nucypher)$ nucypher stake preallocation --withdraw-tokens --allocation-filepath PATH


.. note:: If you're a preallocation user, recall that you're using a contract to stake.
  Replace ``<YOUR STAKER ADDRESS>`` with the contract address when configuring your node.
  If you don't know this address, you'll find it in the preallocation file.

Stake 30000 NU for 90 Periods
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: bash

    (nucypher)$ nucypher stake init --value 30000 --duration 90 --hw-wallet
    ...


Divide stake at index 0, at 15000 NU for 30 additional Periods
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: bash

    (nucypher)$ nucypher stake divide --index 0 --value 15000 --duration 30 --hw-wallet
