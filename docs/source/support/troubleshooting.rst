self.InsufficientTokens(f"Insufficient token balance ({self.token_agent})
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

There is an insufficient amount of NU in your staking account.


ValueError: {'code': -32000, 'message': 'no suitable peers available'}
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a Geth error and not related to ``nucypher``. You are probably running a light node that needs
full nodes willing to serve information to it, but no such nodes were found (a frequent problem on the Goerli Ethereum testnet).


nucypher.blockchain.eth.interfaces.ConnectionFailed: Connection Failed, is IPC enabled
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The provider URI may be incorrect.

For example: if the scheme is ``ipc://`` then the path should be appended as is to the end ``ipc:///home/â€¦``
i.e. **THREE** slashes not two.


Validation error: 'code': -32000, 'message': 'gas required exceeds allowance (8000000) or always failing transaction
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a generic exception thrown by Geth meaning "Transaction Failed".
This error can be caused by a variety of reasons. Each time ``require()`` fails to validate a condition in a contract
without a corresponding check in the ``nucypher`` client itself, this error is raised. Over time, as we update the
client, this generic error will become extinct.

In the most common cases:

- Ensure that your worker is :ref:`bonded to a staker <bond-worker>`.
  You can confirm by running ``nucypher stake list`` and check that `Worker` is set correctly i.e. not ``0x0000``.
- If your worker is configured, ensure that the worker address has (Goerli) ETH and that the correct worker address is
  provided in the Ursula configuration file being used - the default configuration file is ``~/.local/share/nucypher/ursula.json``


builtins.ValueError: {'code': -32000, 'message': 'insufficient funds for gas * price + value'}
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Ursula node does not have enough (Goerli) ETH to pay for transaction gas. Ensure that your worker address has
(Goerli) ETH.


Warning! Error encountered during contract execution [Out of gas]
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The Ursula node does not have enough (Goerli) ETH to pay for transaction gas; ensure that your worker address has (Goerli) ETH.


RuntimeError: Click will abort further execution because Python 3 was configured to use ASCII as encoding for the environment
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Try setting the following environment variables:

.. code::

    export LC_ALL=en_US.utf-8
    export LANG=en_US.utf-8


builtins.FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/<path>/.cache/nucypher/log/nucypher.log.20191227'
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is an artifact of upgrading Ursula - remove the directory ``<path>/.cache/nucypher/log`` and restart Ursula.


web3.exceptions.BadFunctionCallOutput: Could not transact with/call contract function, is contract deployed correctly and chain synced?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This error usually means your blockchain data is not synced.

If using Geth, ensure that Geth is fully synced. You can use the ``--exitwhensynced`` flag which causes Geth
to exit once fully synced.

When using parity in light mode, this is raised when the light node cannot satisfy the call/transaction, e.g. not
enough full nodes are serving requests.


ValueError: {'code': -32000, 'message': 'could not decrypt key with given password'}
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Potential reasons:

    #. You may be using the wrong password for your ethereum account.

    #. You may be using the wrong ethereum account.

    #. If trying to collect rewards, this is a `known bug <https://github.com/nucypher/nucypher/issues/1657>`_ in our
       code - rerun the command without the ``--staking-address`` option.


ValidationError: The field extraData is 97 bytes, but should be 32. It is quite likely that you are connected to a POA chain
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Add the ``--poa`` flag to your command and try again.
